					<description><![CDATA[<p>Do you want to decrease shopping cart abandonment on your eCommerce website but don't know where (or how) to begin?</p>
<p>The post <a href="https://kotlead.com/cart-abandonment-and-ways-to-reduce-it/">Cart abandonment and ways to reduce it</a> first appeared on <a href="https://kotlead.com">Kotlead</a>.</p>]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Do you want to decrease shopping cart abandonment on your eCommerce website but don&#8217;t know where (or how) to begin?</p>



<p>I know that feeling… One of the most significant issues that online business owners deal with is shopping cart abandonment. To put this in a numerical perspective, out of every 10 customers who add an item to their cart, seven of them abandon it without making a purchase. Due to cart abandonment, e-commerce businesses lose $18 billion in sales income every year.</p>



<p><strong>What is cart abandonment?</strong></p>



<p>Cart abandonment is when a customer adds products to their cart but leaves the online store without paying.&nbsp;Cart abandonment may result from customers&#8217; wistful window shopping, where they impulsively add products to their cart without really intending to buy them.</p>



<p>Additionally, customers may abandon their cart after experiencing friction during their online purchases. While the first happens frequently and cannot be prevented, the second can.</p>



<p><strong>Some causes of cart abandonment</strong></p>



<p>Cart abandonment may be very frustrating for retailers—customers have added things to their baskets, indicating a clear interest in their products, but something has kept them from making a purchase. Heads up, an interface that is difficult to navigate or a lengthy checkout process annoys customers and offers them time to reconsider their choices.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>Prolonged or complex checkout procedures.</em></strong></p>



<p>The optimal checkout process is fluid and effortless. This is the standard checkout procedure: Cart &gt; Billing information &gt; Shipping information &gt; Shipping Method &gt; Order Preview &gt; Payment &gt; Confirmation.</p>



<p>A checkout process that does not adhere to a logical order of steps can discourage customers, as that would require an excessive amount of information to complete the transaction, such as the customer&#8217;s phone number, date of birth, or gender.</p>



<p><strong><em>Compulsory account creation.</em></strong></p>



<p>Account creation requires more work, especially if they only want to make a one-time purchase. Consumers might not see the benefit. However, companies frequently require account creation in order to retarget clients with emails and increase lead generation.</p>



<p>First-time purchasers may be hesitant to provide their email addresses or enable the corporation to record their credit card information. From the perspective of the customer, opening an account entails remembering yet another password.</p>



<p><strong><em>Delivery times exceeded expectations.</em></strong></p>



<p>Some online retailers may not disclose an item&#8217;s estimated delivery date until the moment of purchase. Typically, delivery time is dependent on the location of the customer, especially for enterprises that ship internationally. Remember that acceptable delivery windows are decreasing. According to a poll of more than 1,000 U.S. consumers conducted by Alix Partners, consumers are ready to accept a maximum delivery time of 4.5 days, down from 5.5 days in 2012. However, this also depends on the thing in question. As they are built to order, custom products will inevitably require more time. Perishables and household items should be delivered swiftly to ensure food safety and because customers frequently place urgent orders for them. In comparison, delivery windows for durable goods such as furniture are somewhat more flexible.</p>



<p><strong><em>Return and refund policy ambiguity</em></strong></p>



<p>Due to the inability to see and touch the product prior to purchase, internet shoppers face a certain level of risk. Especially for expensive purchases, customers require assurance that they can obtain a refund or return the goods in the event of a problem or if the item is subpar. Providing a generous return policy or a longer return window instills confidence.</p>



<p><strong><em>Insufficient payment options.</em></strong></p>



<p>Due to increasing worries over data breaches and the ubiquity of contactless payment methods, customers seek diverse payment options. Apple Pay, Google Wallet, PayPal, and other digital wallets let people shop online without disclosing credit card information to merchants they may not trust. Through third-party suppliers such as Klarna, many internet retailers offer interest-free buy now, pay later (BNPL) services, which makes it easier for customers to finance larger purchases.</p>



<p><strong><em>Problems with site speed and app performance.</em></strong></p>



<p>People lose faith in your goods or service if your website&#8217;s interface is complicated or if it is slow. 75% of consumers, according to a Stanford research on web reputation, estimate the legitimacy of firms based on the design of their websites. Remember to increase your website&#8217;s uptime and accessibility in accordance with the holiday shopping season.</p>



<p>In addition, conduct cross-browser and cross-device tests to guarantee that your online store is compatible with all browsers and devices. You can discover reports on website performance across devices using Google Analytics: Audience &gt; Technology &gt; Browsers and Operating Systems or Audience &gt; Mobile &gt; Devices.</p>



<p><strong>How to Determine the Shopping Cart Abandonment Rate</strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-1 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="809" data-id="5352" src="https://kotlead.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/cartabandonment-rate-1024x809.png" alt="cart abandonment rate calculation" class="wp-image-5352" srcset="https://kotlead.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/cartabandonment-rate-1024x809.png 1024w, https://kotlead.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/cartabandonment-rate-300x237.png 300w, https://kotlead.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/cartabandonment-rate-768x607.png 768w, https://kotlead.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/cartabandonment-rate.png 1383w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>
</figure>



<p>The Shopping Cart Abandonment Rate is derived by dividing the total number of completed purchases by the total number of created shopping carts. Subtract the result from one and then multiply by 100 to get the abandonment rate.</p>



<p>For instance, if you have 50 completed purchases and 200 shopping carts, your shopping cart abandonment rate is 75%.</p>



<p>1 &#8211; (50 / 200) = 0.75</p>



<p>Multiply by 100 = 75%&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>A few ideas for reducing cart abandonment.</strong></p>

</figure>



<p><strong><em>Provide guest checkout alternatives.</em></strong></p>



<p>Allow customers to bypass account creation if they so choose. This decreases the time required to complete a purchase by eliminating unnecessary procedures while allowing those who do not wish to give their personal information to do so with confidence.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Customers do not need to save their credit card information, and their email addresses will only be used for delivery updates if they opt for guest checkout.</p>



<p><strong><em>Include clear calls to action</em></strong></p>



<p>Nice, clear CTAs that aren&#8217;t deceptive generally pay off!</p>



<p>If shoppers are unsure about what to do next, they shouldn&#8217;t give up on their purchase. Ensure that the CTAs for each stage are distinct and employ standard language; avoid being innovative or cutesy. To commence the checkout process, the next call-to-action should be &#8220;Buy Now&#8221; after &#8220;Add to Cart.&#8221;</p>



<p><strong><em>Provide a range of distribution options</em></strong></p>



<p>When making purchases, customers frequently take shipping fees and delivery times into account. Therefore, be sure to offer choices that satisfy the requirements of your various clients. Do not display shipping costs to customers just before they are ready to complete their purchase. Delivery fees at the checkout may look to customers as &#8220;extra&#8221; fees, discouraging them.</p>



<p>Giving them a choice of delivery options keeps you flexible. Some clients may expect free or affordable delivery, while others may be more concerned with ease and quickness.</p>



<p>To suit a range of client preferences, sales sites should try to offer a number of delivery options.</p>



<p><strong><em>Make a guest checkout available.</em></strong></p>



<p>Customers ought to be given the option to forego creating accounts if they so desire. Making clients register and create accounts before allowing them to use the checkout process could prevent them from making a purchase.</p>



<p>When not absolutely essential, it makes prudent to get around this restriction and offer guests other checkout options.</p>



<p><strong><em>Be Clear About Total Costs</em></strong></p>



<p>Don&#8217;t surprise customers with extra taxes and fees at the checkout. They will believe they were duped. The discovery of &#8220;hidden&#8221; costs while paying for anything is a common reason for cart abandonment. When it comes to shipping, handling, and tax fees, be truthful. If feasible, include a range for shipping prices prior to checkout if you are unable to provide an exact figure (e.g., $2.99 to $3.99 for domestic delivery; $4.99 to $10.99 for international shipping).</p>



<p><strong><em>Add status indications to the checkout page.</em></strong></p>



<p>Progress bars are an excellent UI element since they inform users of the number of remaining stages in a user flow. This provides a sense of momentum that minimizes the possibility that a customer may abandon the checkout process due to its length.</p>



<p>An almost completed progress bar provides shoppers with visual encouragement to complete their purchases because they can see how much they have already committed in the checkout process. On your website, you may also incorporate a simple reminder or notification for the cart. For instance, if a consumer adds an item to their shopping cart but does not commence the checkout process, you can configure a pop-up to remind them that they have not yet finished the purchase.</p>



<p><strong><em>Optimize page load speeds</em></strong></p>



<p>Monitor site availability and uptime closely, especially during high seasons. Slow website load times can significantly reduce conversion rates.</p>



<p>According to a 2019 study by Portent, the optimal load time for conversion rates is between 0 and 4 seconds. On pages with load times between 0 and 2 seconds, eCommerce conversion rates are the highest. Each additional second of load time results in an average 0.3% decrease in conversion rates.</p>



<p><strong>Marketing Strategies to Prevent Shopping Cart Abandonment</strong></p>



<p>In addition to optimizing your website, you may utilize eCommerce marketing outreach to prevent customers from abandoning their shopping carts or to retarget cart abandoners.</p>



<p><strong><em>Utilize the exit-intent pop-up.</em></strong></p>



<p>Exit pop-ups are a form of website overlay that appears when a user attempts to leave the page in an effort to urge them to remain. Exit Intent technologies monitor the user&#8217;s mouse movement on the website. The pop-up is activated when the cursor leaves the active area of the browser (the real content window in the middle of the page). You can tailor the message based on the type of person or the page they are seeing.</p>



<p>For customers who have added items to their shopping cart, the departure pop-up can provide an incentive or coupon code to encourage them to complete the transaction.</p>



<p><strong><em>Retarget shopping cart abandoners.</em></strong></p>



<p>Retargeted advertisements provide consumers with an inviting invitation to complete their purchases. Determine the leading causes of shopping cart abandonment. This allows you to customize the advertisement and build templates for the most common situations.</p>



<p>If delivery costs are the issue, provide free shipping. Customers are 40% more likely to engage with advertisements and make a purchase if the material is customized. Begin by encouraging shoppers who have abandoned their carts with a polite CTA to complete the transaction. Make sure to utilize multiple retargeting channels, as ads should encompass both web and social.</p>



<p><strong><em>emails with a personalized follow-up.</em></strong></p>



<p>An abandoned cart email campaign should include a reminder to customers of the items in their shopping basket (including an itemized list with clickable URLs). Incorporate additional product suggestions for related or complimentary things, such as accessories, into your email designs.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s possible that they abandoned their cart because they couldn&#8217;t find exactly what they were looking for; therefore, proposing alternative products in a follow-up email can be useful. Offer an incentive or discount coupon if they are a first-time visitor.</p>



<p>If they&#8217;re not ready to make a purchase, utilize cart abandonment emails and cart recovery emails to invite them to join up for your newsletter so they may receive special deals and see your newest products.</p>



<p><strong>Final thoughts</strong></p>



<p>The chance of customer churn can be reduced by optimizing your website and delivering a user-friendly purchasing experience. Examine your conversion funnels to differentiate between window shoppers and clients with purchase intent who abandon due to friction.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Should I create buyer personas that target the company I would like to work with or should I target the decision-makers of these companies?</p>
<p>The post <a href="https://kotlead.com/buyer-persona-vs-ideal-customer/">Buyer Persona Vs Ideal Customer Profile (ICP), which should I target?</a> first appeared on <a href="https://kotlead.com">Kotlead</a>.</p>]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Should I create buyer personas that target the company I would like to work with or should I be targeting the decision-makers of these companies?</em></p>



<p>For example:</p>



<p><em>ABC company struggles with website design and spends time searching for marketing agencies via Google Search and LinkedIn.</em></p>



<p>or</p>



<p><em>Jane Doe, Marketing Director of ABC Company identifies a lack of talent amongst her marketing team specifically in SEO. Jane spends time hiring new talent from LinkedIn or Indeed but hasn&#8217;t found an individual worth justifying the expense of onboarding a full-time employee.</em></p>



<p>The majority of individuals frequently confuse a buyer persona with an ideal customer profile. Understanding the differences is crucial because it gives you the knowledge you need to produce engaging content that will draw in new clients.</p>



<p>Let us first define the terms before deciding which to target.</p>



<p><strong>Ideal Customer Profile</strong></p>



<p>An ideal customer profile is a business description that meets all requirements to be considered a client or customer. According to HubSpot, an ideal customer profile (ICP), also known as an ideal buyer profile, defines the ideal customer for what your company fulfils. This is a fictitious company with all of the characteristics that would make it the best fit for the solutions you offer.</p>



<p><strong>Buyer Persona</strong></p>



<p>A buyer persona is a semi-fictitious, generalised representation of your customers that takes into account their demographics, goals, motivators, and challenges. Buyer personas give your company structure and context. It includes information about their decision-making process. A great buyer persona doesn’t just help you set your sights on the ideal customer, it also shows you where to find your ideal customer, how to get their attention, and ultimately, how to persuade them.</p>



<p><strong>Differences between an Ideal Customer Profile and a buyer persona</strong></p>



<p>Understanding your Ideal Customer Profile and your customer persona is crucial because it enables you to create content that will appeal to your intended audience.</p>



<p>An Ideal Customer Profile and a buyer persona differ in the following ways:</p>



<ol><li>An Ideal Customer profile is a descriptive profile of a company best fit to use your services while a buyer persona is a person that needs your services. For instance, a company that tends to be very busy with administrative work is your ICP while medical students between 20 and 35 are your buyer persona.&nbsp;</li><li>An Ideal Customer Profile tells you whom you should sell to while a buyer persona is used to craft a more targeted campaign in regards to the medium used.</li><li>your ideal customer profile is a description of the type of company you should try to sell to and your buyer persona is a detailed analysis of the people who buy from you.</li><li>Buyer personas define the different buying patterns of companies within your ideal customer profile.</li></ol>

<p>Creating&nbsp;your&nbsp;ICP&nbsp;and&nbsp;buyer&nbsp;personas&nbsp;can&nbsp;be&nbsp;mutually&nbsp;beneficial.&nbsp;Your&nbsp;buyer&nbsp;personas&nbsp;inform&nbsp;your&nbsp;teams&nbsp;about&nbsp;the&nbsp;types&nbsp;of&nbsp;people&nbsp;they&nbsp;are&nbsp;creating&nbsp;content&nbsp;for,&nbsp;prospecting&nbsp;for,&nbsp;and&nbsp;the&nbsp;kinds&nbsp;of&nbsp;questions&nbsp;they&nbsp;should&nbsp;be&nbsp;prepared&nbsp;to&nbsp;answer. On the other hand, you&nbsp;want&nbsp;to&nbsp;make&nbsp;sure&nbsp;that&nbsp;your&nbsp;ICP&nbsp;is&nbsp;advising&nbsp;your&nbsp;company&nbsp;on&nbsp;the businesses&nbsp;they&nbsp;should&nbsp;be&nbsp;targeting&nbsp;by&nbsp;defining&nbsp;the&nbsp;qualities&nbsp;that&nbsp;are&nbsp;needed.</p>



<p><strong>Consider this in terms of a funnel.</strong></p>



<p>Your TOF lead generation ads will use broad messaging to target buckets of businesses based on industry verticals. This is your search, display, and social content; it&#8217;s broad, branded, and speaks to a large audience, here Reach is the primary goal, at least at first.</p>



<p>Your MOF lead generation will use messaging that is a little more specific, but still primarily speaking to those companies. You should demonstrate experience, authority, or a portfolio to validate their initial interaction with your advertising. Web content, retargeting ads, or responsive display ads are examples of this.</p>



<p>When you begin speaking directly to decision-makers, you are generating BOF leads. This can be web content at the bottom of pages or to the right of the nav bar (so closer to conversion points or further along the user journey), or it can be an email/outreach drip.</p>



<p>In essence, creating company personas is like casting a wide net, whereas creating buyer personas is like casting a hook and lure. Both are necessary, but you should only use them when necessary.</p>



<p><strong>Final thoughts</strong></p>



<p>Imagine a persona as a person and ICP as a company. When producing content, it is beneficial to use a buyer persona because a person is easier to target than a company. ICPs and buyer personas can both be used in a plan, but it&#8217;s vital to remember that businesses don&#8217;t read blogs or social media; rather, their employees do. As a result, when developing content, it is more prudent to target buyer personas.</p>



<p>ABC Company is your ICP (Ideal Customer Profile), and it&#8217;s a company. The ICP tells you whom you sell to.</p>



<p>Jane Doe is an actual persona. The persona tells you how you should sell (what content to create, which channels, etc)</p>



<p>You can use both in a strategy, but for content creation, you need to use personas. Companies don&#8217;t read blog posts; they don&#8217;t sign contracts, and they don&#8217;t use social media. People who work for these companies do.</p><p>The post <a href="https://kotlead.com/buyer-persona-vs-ideal-customer/">Buyer Persona Vs Ideal Customer Profile (ICP), which should I target?</a> first appeared on <a href="https://kotlead.com">Kotlead</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Understanding your target audience may help you run more effective advertisements since customers will feel more connected to your brand. Whether you&#8217;re just starting out or expanding your company, you must understand who your consumers are and how to attract them. Your company will not be able to survive if it does not have clients. Where will you locate customers? A target market is something you should be aware of. Let&#8217;s talk about target audiences and how to find yours. </p>



<p>A target audience is a group of people who are distinguished by their activity and demographics, such as&nbsp;<em>female extreme athletes between the ages of 18 and 25</em>. Target audiences are used by most businesses to influence marketing strategy decisions such as where to spend money on advertisements, how to appeal to customers, and even what product to produce next.</p>



<p>Target audiences are also used to define a company&#8217;s buyer persona. Buyer personas are a representative summary of a company&#8217;s ideal consumer based on data from a target population; however, we will discuss this in another post. Here are some examples of demographics and behavioural traits:</p>



<ul><li>Location</li><li>Age</li><li>Gender</li><li>Education background</li><li>Purchasing power</li><li>Social class</li><li>Location</li><li>Consumption habits</li></ul>



<p>This information is helpful in understanding the customer and how they make purchasing decisions. Targeting a certain audience can also assist your campaigns to reach the people who will best relate to your company&#8217;s messages and offerings.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Differences between Target Audience and Target Market</strong></p>



<p>When discussing a target audience, it is important not to mistake the phrase with a target market. While they are similar, the distinction is&nbsp;<strong><em>key</em></strong>&nbsp;for marketers.&nbsp;Though both target audience and target markets are concerned with segmenting customers into groups in order to make educated business decisions, a target market is a specific set of consumers to whom a company&#8217;s products are marketed.</p>



<p>A target audience is a group based on demographics, interests, and purchasing history.&nbsp;Simply said, you may explain your target market by identifying your target audience. If the target market was &#8220;marketers aged 25-35,&#8221; the target audience would be &#8220;marketers aged 25-35 residing in Boston, Massachusetts.&#8221;</p>



<p><strong>Types of Target Audience</strong></p>



<p>We&#8217;ve gone through the characteristics that make up a demographic. There are several in the marketing field, all of which are useful in identifying the right audience. When we talk about target audience types, we&#8217;re talking about more ways to describe whom you&#8217;re planning a campaign for. You may classify your audience into groups or further define them using categories such as:</p>



<ol><li><strong>Purchase Intention:</strong> A group of people who are seeking a certain product and wish to gather additional information before making a purchase decision. Consumers purchasing a new laptop, vehicle, clothing, or television are a few instances. This information is required to determine how to properly target your content to your target audience.</li><li><strong>Interests:</strong> This is information on what individuals are interested in, such as hobbies. Knowing this information allows you to engage with your audience more significantly and uncover customer motivations and habits. People who prefer road riding as a pastime, for example, are likely to be most interested in new road bikes in the spring when the weather warms up and the road racing season begins. For example, if you discover that a high number of potential consumers are interested in travellin<strong>g</strong>, you might incorporate that message into your marketing campaign to attract additional buyers.</li><li><strong>Subculture</strong>:<strong> </strong>These are groups of individuals who share the same experience. A distinct music scene or entertainment genre is one example of this. Subcultures define people, and corporations may utilize those subcultures to understand whom they&#8217;re reaching out to. Consider how they connect to your business, especially if you have a huge prospective audience. Netflix, for example, appeals to subcultures of individuals who watch certain sorts of material through social media accounts dedicated to such subcultures.</li></ol>



<p><strong>How to find your Target Audience</strong></p>

<p>As you might expect, developing a target audience requires some study into whom you want to reach and how you can get there in a way that differentiates you from competitors.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re ready to discover yours, these are the steps you should follow:</p>



<ol><li>&nbsp;Use Google Analytics to learn more about your customers.</li><li>&nbsp;Create a reader persona to target blog content.</li><li>&nbsp;Look at social media analytics.</li><li>Use Facebook Insights.</li><li>Check on website performance.</li><li>Engage with social media audiences.</li></ol>



<p>Knowing your target audience is a great idea as it helps you focus on people who are most likely to convert. Also, prioritizing the target audience helps you define the type of person that your marketing campaign can be directed at.</p><p>The post <a href="https://kotlead.com/how-to-determine-your-target-audience/">How to determine your target audience.</a> first appeared on <a href="https://kotlead.com">Kotlead</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You want visitors to your e-commerce site to add a lot of items to their carts and spend a lot of money. Although that makes sense, what if they don&#8217;t? 7 out of 10 visitors who add an item to their cart eventually leave without making a purchase.</p>



<p>Online shoppers are constantly looking for information, and occasionally they don&#8217;t react right away, at least not in the way you want. For instance, customers might leave right away. They are interrupted from their computer screens by phone calls or turn off their mobile devices when they reach their destinations. The truth is that not every customer can be acquired on the first visit. For this reason, we have collected the advice we believe will enable you to recognize marketing tactics that aim to draw in these visitors and persuade them with a secondary product offer.</p>



<p>Prior to discussing the key suggestions and bullet points, it is important to define keywords;</p>



<p>E-commerce</p>



<p>A business model that enables organizations and people to buy and sell goods online. Four marketing segments are active in e-commerce, including:</p>



<p>business-to-business (B2B).</p>



<p>business-to-consumer (B2C).</p>



<p>consumer-to-consumer (C2C).</p>



<p>consumer-to-business (C2B).</p>



<p>Conversion funnel</p>



<p>A marketing funnel is a list of all the different paths a prospective customer can take from learning about your products or brand to buying those products. By using this model, businesses can better understand the needs of their customers at every stage, maximize their marketing efforts, and increase sales.</p>



<p>Creating an effective E-commerce marketing funnel: Some pointers</p>



<p></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="569" src="https://kotlead.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/imagefor-funnel-1024x569.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-5340" srcset="https://kotlead.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/imagefor-funnel-1024x569.jpeg 1024w, https://kotlead.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/imagefor-funnel-300x167.jpeg 300w, https://kotlead.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/imagefor-funnel-768x427.jpeg 768w, https://kotlead.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/imagefor-funnel.jpeg 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>An e-commerce sales funnel consists of several steps, commonly referred to as the top, middle, and bottom of the funnel, though these steps can change depending on the retailer&#8217;s sales model. We will provide a step-by-step tutorial on these marketing funnels in our following post.</p>



<p>Learn about your audience</p>



<p>Without being aware of the problems and interests of your customers, it is impossible to create a marketing funnel. Investigate the clientele of your rivals for additional insightful information; you probably have a lot in common. Pay attention to survey results, social media, web analytics, and feedback from your current clients as well.</p>



<p>Learn how your customers behave.</p>



<p>Along with figuring out who your clients are, try to comprehend how they use your websites and other resources. What TV shows do they favor? What obstacle prevents them from making a purchase? What uncertainties and issues do they encounter while making the purchase? Finding the best location for your funnel and ways to move customers through it are made easier by providing answers to all of these.</p>



<p>Decide how many stages there will be.</p>



<p>Modern marketing funnels do not necessarily require your customers to proceed through all of the stages. You can define six steps or just focus on the top, middle, and bottom of the funnel rather than post-purchase stages. The exa6model is based on the model of your buyers.</p>



<p>Find the most successful marketing strategies</p>



<p>This will enable you to transform the marketing funnel into a useful tool. Consider your desired channels, tactics, and content types to use for each stage. For instance, you might use blog posts or PPC ads to draw in leads, nurture those leads with email marketing, and then persuade those leads to buy your products through case studies or events.</p>



<p>Utilize customer relationship management software (CRM)</p>



<p>CRM tools like Hubspot assist businesses in managing client relationships, allocating sales representatives in charge of each deal, and corresponding with clients via chat or email. With OptiMonk, marketers can increase email list size, lower cart abandonment, advertise exclusive deals, and more.</p>



<p>Contact <a href="https://kotlead.com/book-a-call/" target="_blank" rel="noopener ugc">Kotlead</a> for knowledgeable assistance.</p>



<p>Although it is fantastic to use these tools to your marketing advantage, there are always time, experience, and cost considerations. Because of this, working with Kotlead as a consultant will give you the freedom to concentrate on product development while our team utilize these tools to your advantage. We have the necessary time, experience, and expertise to increase sales on your e-commerce website.</p>



<p>Track modifications</p>



<p>A marketing funnel cannot be created and left unattended. Test new marketing strategies and content formats to make this tool more effective. Keep an eye out for shifts in your customers&#8217; behaviour.</p>



<p>While it is great to use these tools to your marketing advantage, there is always time constraint, experience and cost. That is why consulting with Kotlead will afford you the leverage to focus on product development, while our team focus on utilizing these tools to your business advantage. We have the experience, time, and skills relevant to driving sales to your e-commerce website.</p>



<p id="1ed9">Keep track of changes.</p>



<p id="1380">You cannot just craft a marketing funnel and call it a day. To make this tool effective, remember to test new marketing tactics and content formats. Look for changes in your customers’ behaviour.</p>



<p id="2ae9"><strong>Wrapping up</strong></p>



<p id="b029">The e-commerce marketing funnel can prove complicated, but if you’re armed with the right data, you can improve the user experience and generate more sales. That’s why I recommend collecting data frequently. And in most cases where such data seem ambiguous, too complex, and difficult to obtain, you can always contact <a href="https://kotlead.com/book-a-call/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kotlead</a> to help you do the dirty work of extracting, transforming, and using that data to create marketing insight.</p><p>The post <a href="https://kotlead.com/how-to-create-a-successful-ecommerce-marketing-funnel-2/">How to create a successful eCommerce marketing funnel.</a> first appeared on <a href="https://kotlead.com">Kotlead</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>
